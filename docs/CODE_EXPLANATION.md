# PROTECTSELFNOWASAP - Code Explanation
## Personal Security Research Project

### What This Code Does

This is a **simulation** of security features for brain-computer interfaces. It shows how future neural devices could protect user privacy.

### Core Features Simulated:

1. **Air-Gap Mode** - Like a physical switch to turn off wireless
2. **Biometric Lock** - Only responds to your brain patterns  
3. **Panic Button** - Emergency disconnect thought
4. **Security Log** - Records all access attempts

### Important Notes:

- This is **RESEARCH CODE** only
- Doesn't connect to real brain devices
- Doesn't access anyone's actual brain data
- **Legal security research** - like studying how to make better passwords

### Why This Research Matters:

As brain-computer interfaces develop, we need to ensure:
- People control their own brain data
- No unauthorized access to thoughts
- Emergency shutoff capabilities

### This is similar to:
- Studying computer security before computers existed
- Researching car safety before cars were common
- Planning privacy protections before the technology arrives

This code represents **responsible research** into future privacy protections.
